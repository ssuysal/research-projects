This portfolio contains selected empirical research and data analysis projects completed during my Master of Science in Economics at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows, from data acquisition and preparation to statistical modelling and clear communication of findings via visualizations and reports.

Each project includes:
- **Context & Objective** – the research question or business problem
- **Methods & Tools** – statistical techniques, programming languages, and platforms used
- **Results & Insights** – key findings and implications

## Master's Thesis  
**Profit Shifting by Multinational Firms through Intangible Assets: The Role of Patent Boxes**  
*Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich – Grade: 1.3*

- Analysed firm-level ORBIS & ORBIS Historical data (2014–2022) retrieved via SQL batch queries.  
- Built a full R-based pipeline for data cleaning, harmonisation, merging, modelling, and visualisation.  
- Applied Difference-in-Differences with Coarsened Exact Matching to identify effects.  
- **Finding:** Patent box regimes were associated with increased profit shifting, especially for firms with historical patent ownership.

## Machine Learning in Econometrics  
**Gender Inequality Analysis: Evaluating 2007 U.S. Policy Interventions**

- Applied Causal Forests, Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting, and Double/Debiased ML methods.  
- Conducted heterogeneity analysis using Lasso-penalised GLMs.  
- Automated result generation with reproducible R scripts and visual outputs.  
- **Finding:** Significant subgroup-specific policy effects were detected.

## Empirical Public Finance  
**Pay Transparency and Racial Wage Gaps in the U.S. Labor Market**

- Staggered Difference-in-Differences using CPS microdata (2010–2024).  
- Focused on Maryland, Nevada, Colorado, California, and Washington.  
- **Finding:** Pay transparency laws reduced racial wage gaps, especially benefiting Black women.

## Data Analytics Project  
**Elections and Speeches: Parliamentary Discourse Analysis in Canada**

- Web scraping with Python (Selenium) to collect speeches and metadata (1980–2020).  
- Topic modelling, clustering, and fixed effects regressions to link themes to electoral outcomes.  
- **Finding:** Issue-salient topics correlated positively with vote shares.

## Digital Currencies Research  
**Digital Currencies in the International Monetary System**

- Analysed implications of crypto-assets, stablecoins, and CBDCs for monetary policy and financial stability.  
- Developed a framework for impact channels (monetary, financial, payments) and regulatory needs.  
- **Finding:** Highlighted the different policy implications of public vs. private digital currencies.
