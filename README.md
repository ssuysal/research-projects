## Master's Thesis  
**Title**: *Profit Shifting by Multinational Firms through Intangible Assets: The Role of Patent Boxes*  
**Institution**: Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich  
**Grade**: 1.3  

**Research focus**: Investigating whether patent box regimes incentivize profit shifting among multinational firms.

**Methodology**:
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM)
- Panel data analysis using firm-level ORBIS data (2014–2022)

**Software & tools**: R

**Key findings**: Patent box regimes were associated with increased profit shifting, particularly among firms with historical patent ownership.

## Machine Learning in Econometrics  
**Title**: *Gender Inequality Analysis: Evaluating 2007 U.S. Policy Interventions*  
**Institution**: Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich  

**Research focus**: Using machine learning techniques for causal inference and policy evaluation on gender wage and employment gaps.

**Methodology**:
- Causal Forests for heterogeneous treatment effects
- Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting (AIPW)
- Double/Debiased Machine Learning
- Lasso-penalized GLMs

**Software & tools**: R (grf, glmnet, ranger)

**Highlights**:
- Propensity score diagnostics and variable importance plots
- Heterogeneity analysis by quintiles
- Automated result generation with visual outputs

**Key findings**: Significant heterogeneous treatment effects were identified across subgroups using robust causal inference methods.

## Empirical Public Finance  
**Title**: *Pay Transparency and Racial Wage Gaps in the U.S. Labor Market*  
**Institution**: Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich  

**Research focus**: Analyzing the effects of state-level pay transparency legislation on racial wage gaps across five U.S. states.

**Methodology**:
- Staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design
- Panel data analysis using CPS microdata (2010–2024)

**Software & tools**: R

**Highlights**:
- State-level analysis: Maryland, Nevada, Colorado, California, Washington
- Focus on wage outcomes for Black and White workers
- Identification strategy accounts for staggered policy timing

**Key findings**: Transparency laws led to notable wage gains for Black workers, especially Black women, and significantly reduced racial wage gaps.

## Data Analytics Project  
**Title**: *Elections and Speeches: Parliamentary Discourse Analysis in Canada*  
**Institution**: Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich  

**Research focus**: Exploring the relationship between speech content and electoral performance among Canadian parliamentarians (1980–2020).

**Methodology**:
- Web scraping (Python, Selenium)
- Natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling
- K-means clustering
- Fixed effects regression models

**Software & tools**: Python, R

**Highlights**:
- Large-scale speech and metadata extraction
- Topic frequency analysis by party and politician
- Empirical link between discourse themes and electoral outcomes

**Key findings**: Topics linked to salient public issues were positively correlated with vote shares, highlighting the electoral value of thematic focus in political messaging.

## Digital Currencies Research  
**Title**: *Digital Currencies in the International Monetary System*  

**Research focus**: Examining the implications of digital currencies (crypto-assets, stablecoins, and CBDCs) for international financial stability and monetary sovereignty.

**Methodology**:
- Comparative policy analysis
- Impact channel framework (monetary, financial, payments)
- Case study review and regulatory analysis

**Software & tools**: Policy research and qualitative analysis

**Highlights**:
- Classification of private vs. public digital currencies
- Cross-border payments and capital flow considerations
- International cooperation and governance challenges

**Key findings**: The study outlines regulatory risks and cooperation needs, highlighting the distinction between private digital assets and CBDCs in shaping the future monetary landscape.
